# Web Stack Debugging #0

## Introduction

This project focuses on the fundamentals of debugging within a web stack environment. As a DevOps engineer or SysAdmin, mastering the art of debugging is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of web applications. Through this project, we aim to hone your skills in identifying and rectifying issues within a web server setup.

# Project Overview

In this particular task, you'll be provided with a scenario where an Apache server needs to be configured to return a specific webpage upon querying its root.
