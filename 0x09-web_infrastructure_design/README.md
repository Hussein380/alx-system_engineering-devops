# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to a series of tasks related to designing and understanding web infrastructure. The tasks cover various aspects such as single-server setups, distributed infrastructures, security considerations, monitoring, and scalability.

# Project Structure

The project is organized into directories corresponding to each task:

- 0x09-web_infrastructure_design
- 0-simple_web_stack. Design a basic web infrastructure on a single server.
 - 1-distributed_web_infrastructure: Design a distributed web infrastructure with load balancing and redundancy.
  - 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure: Design a secured and monitored web infrastructure with firewalls, SSL, and monitoring.
  - 3-scale_up: Explore scaling up the infrastructure with clustered servers.

# Task Completion

Each task directory contains diagrams and explanations for the designed infrastructure. Additionally, screenshots of the whiteboard sessions are included to demonstrate task completion. 

# How to Use

To view the solutions and diagrams:

1. Navigate to the respective task directory.
2. Open the README.md file to read the explanations.
3. Check the screenshots folder for whiteboard session screenshots.

# Requirements

- Whiteboard or paper for drawing diagrams.
- Understanding of web infrastructure concepts including servers, databases, load balancers, DNS, security, and monitoring.
